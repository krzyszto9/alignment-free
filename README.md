Implementation of alignment-free sequence comparison methods
============================================================
Alignment-based methods for sequence comparison proved to be fundamental to clarifying the function of thousands of various protein or gene families. However, processes such as recombination, exon/domain shuffling or the existence of low sequence similarity families make these methods ineffective. As a result, a new sequence comparison methods were developed, which provide alternatives over alignment-based approaches. Implementations of alignment-free methods are still rare, but if they exist: (i) they are not included in a single program or website, (ii) they use external programs, and (iii) their service is extremely difficult and non-intuitive for the average user.
